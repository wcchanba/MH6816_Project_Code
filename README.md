# Introduction
In this report, we conduct a comparative analysis of different algorithms by implementing them and evaluating their performance. Our objective is to assess their efficiency based on key performance metrics and derive meaningful insights from the results. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of their suitability for various applications.

## Library Used
In this implementation, we use the PyCryptodome library to perform encryption and decryption operations on data packets of varying sizes. PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives. It contains some of the functions for the algorithms that we need to implement.
